# Data_Science_With_Python
This repository is created for learning the basics of data science with Python and other projects I've completed for academic, self-learning and other educational purposes.
### Practice Project data science topics include: 
  - Web Scraping
  - Data Wrangling
  - EDA
  - Feature Engineering
  - Feature Selection

### Two projects will be created which include topics from the above list:
1. Customer Service Data Analysis : We will analyze data on service request calls from New York City by using various Python libraries.
2. Movielens Case Study : We need to find features that predict the ratings of a movie, and build a model that can be used to predict the ratings.
